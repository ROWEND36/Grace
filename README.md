There will come a time in every one in two developer's life when he decides that there is something irreparably wrong with his development environment.
Such a developer might then make the mistake of believing the solution is to make his own editor.
The work of this repository is show you exactlty how bad an idea that is.
And if you ever decide you want to do so anyway, then at least start from somewhere that is not eqivalent to an Android TextView.


Grace is an incomplete mobile editor with syntax highlighting for over 100 languages, snippets completion for most of them, smart autocompletion for javascript and other stuff like
~A built in filemanager
~A working search and replace feature
~50+ themes(although you will generally use only 2 or 3)

It is not a finished product. It is the second best editor there is for Android currently. And if you are unwilling to install Termux and Vim(which is the best editor in the world by the way), then it is your best bet.
PS: Did I mention it has optional vim keybindings?

Most of it is built on Ace Editor, the javascript engine of Amazon's Cloud 9 editor. If you ever think of donating to this project, please send an email to rowendduke36@gmail.com.
